## 🔎 Analysis

The complexity of exam #1 is explained as below:

* store: let n is the number of key-value pairs in Dict and m is the number of Dict in an array. The complexity is O(nm), which is equal to the complexity takes to traverse a 2D array.

* load: the complexity in the code is O(nm) but it could be reduced to O(n) with 1 loop.
